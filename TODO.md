Version 2.0
-----------

* Rename methods to indicate that the belong to ariles, e.g., `readConfig()` ->
  `arilesRead()`.

* Investigate possibility of generalization of functionality to enable addition
  of custom operations over Ariles classes, e.g., register/unregister.

* Rename `finalize()` and `setDefaults()` to something like `arilesPreRead()`,
  `arilesPostRead()`. Add the same functionality for writing configuration files.

* Bug: all ariles classes are `finalize()`d after reading a configuration, but
  manual call to `finalize()` does not guarantee that. If necessary, use
  autogenerated `finalizeAriles()` method instead, which in turn may call
  `finalize()` methods multiple times for the same class. Fix requires API
  changes and is postponed to version 2.
