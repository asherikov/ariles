* New architecture and API.

  may appear.
* Added tests for the new API.


Fixed
-----
* Fixed in the new API: all ariles classes are `finalize()`d after reading a
  configuration, but manual call to `finalize()` does not guarantee that. If
  necessary, use autogenerated `finalizeAriles()` method instead, which in turn
  may call `finalize()` methods multiple times for the same class.
