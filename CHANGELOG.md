Unreleased
==========

1.6.0
=====

Changed
-------

* Compile visitors into shared libraries.
* cmake cleanups & fixes.



1.5.0
=====

Removed
-------

* Do not build third party libraries from sources.



1.4.0
=====

Added
-----

* New architecture and API.
* Old API is reimplemented on top of the new API. Minor compatibility issues
  may appear.
* Added tests for the new API.


Fixed
-----
* Fixed in the new API: all ariles classes are `finalize()`d after reading a
  configuration, but manual call to `finalize()` does not guarantee that. If
  necessary, use autogenerated `finalizeAriles()` method instead, which in turn
  may call `finalize()` methods multiple times for the same class.
