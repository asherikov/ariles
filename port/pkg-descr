Ariles is a C++ serialization/configuration library with some extra automatic
code generation capabilities. It relies on third-party libraries for support of
various data representation formats. The library also provides some predefined
serialization wrappers for common types.

Supported formats:

* YAML via yaml-cpp, both old C++03 and new API supported.
* msgpack via msgpack-c.
* JSON via RapidJSON, with optional Jsonnet preprocessing.
* XML via PugiXML.
* Octave script, output only, no dependencies.
