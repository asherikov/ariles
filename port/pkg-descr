`ariles` is a C++ meta-programming library with focus on serialization and
configuration. It employs preprocessor macro to automatically generate
boilerplate code which facilitates implementation of generic processors
(visitors) for classes. A number of visitors is included in the library, in
particular parsers and emitters of data in various formats, such as `YAML`,
`JSON`, `XML`. `ariles` also provides predefined serialization wrappers for
some common types, e.g., standard containers, smart pointers, `Eigen` matrices.
